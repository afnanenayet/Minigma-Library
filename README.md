# Minigma-Library
C++ files that can be used to encrypt and decrypt strings based on a cipher/password

##How to use
With these files, you just need to include "Encoder.h" and "Decoder.h" provided you have all the files available in your project.
These files allow you to pass two strings, one with a password, and one with a message/encrypted message and you can encode and decode these strings based on a cipher/password.
